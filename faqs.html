    <p class="question">Why do I need to provide my Github login
    details to add comments?</p>

    <p>You need a free <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>
    account to make comments on the book. You will be redirected to
    Github to login to authenticate to the website. When this is
    complete, you <i>temporarily</i> grant us access to your public
    repositories. However, we do not store your authorization
    tokens on the server side and instead use a client-side cookie
    on your browser. To log out, simply delete the cookie.</p>

    <p>Once authenticated, every paragraph in the book will now
    have a <tt>(comments)</tt> link just beside it. Clicking on
    this link will show you all the comments that other reviewers
    have made. You can enter your own feedback in there, which will
    result in an issue being created on the <a href="http://github.com/realworldocaml/rwo-comments/issues">RWO
    comments repository</a>. This issue will be created using your
    own Github account, and makes it easier for Anil, Yaron and
    Jason to follow up with questions.</p>

    <p>You will receive e-mail notifications from Github whenever
    the issue is updated (either with a followup, or just a
    notification that we've fixed your problem in the next revision
    of the book).</p>

    <p class="question">Do I create a new issue if I want to
    comment on someone else's comment?</p>

    <p>No. If you are browsing comments and you want to start a
    thread on someone else's comment, then just follow the link
    marked <tt>(github)</tt> right beside that particular comment.
    This will take you directly to the Github issue tracker where
    you can lodge your feedback.</p>

    <p class="question">Why do I need to grant you so much access
    to the rest of my Github?</p>

    <p>Sadly, the Github oAuth mechanism is severely limited in how
    much access control that we can request. We just want the
    ability to create issues in one specific <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments">public
    repository</a>, but the minimum privileges we can request from
    Github are the ones you see when you login. If you can convince
    someone at Github to add more granular permissions, let us
    know! However, we <i>never</i> store your authorization tokens
    in our server, and instead just directly pass your
    authorization token into a client-side cookie.</p>

    <p class="question">Who is Bactrian the Double Humped OCaml,
    and why does this mysterious ungulate comment on every
    issue?</p>

    <p>We use Github to store all the comments recorded against
    book milestones instead of keeping our own database. To render
    the HTML pages, we need to map back every Github issue into a
    concrete paragraph and milestone id, which is done via the
    labels associated with every comment in the issue repository.
    However, the book contents obviously change every milestone,
    and so we found it convenient to have a <a href="http://github.com/bactrian">bot</a> that uses the <a href="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github">OCaml Github bindings</a>
    to add a contextual link containing the paragraph text to every
    comment. This lets us (the authors) browse all of the book
    issues directly using the excellent Github UI, and jump
    straight to the relevant section in the HTML version of the
    book if we need to.</p>

    <p>Bactrian is a double-humped camel to distinguish us from our
    single-humped Perl friends. Remember, a dromedary camel has one
    hump and a bactrian has two (writing the D and the B will help you
    tell them apart). We're still giddy that we bagged a camel for our
    book...</p>

    <p class="question">What license is the book released
    under?</p>

    <p>The online HTML version of the book is available under a
    <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">Creative
    Commons Attribution- Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0
    United States License</a>, which means that you are welcome to
    copy, distribute and transmit the work, but must give us
    attribution, not create derived works from it, or use it
    directly for commercial purposes (it's fine to use to within
    your workplace to learn OCaml, of course, but not to re-sell
    the book directly.</p>

    <p>We'd like to thank O'Reilly for their generosity in allowing
    this online version to be available freely. Of course, we
    encourage you to also purchase a copy of the book from them.
    The O'Reilly production team is doing a tremendous job of
    typesetting and editing the print version of the book into a
    beautiful edition that's worthy of a place on your shelf.</p>

    <p class="question">Is the source code to the website
    commenting system available?</p>

    <p>It's not right now, but only because the authors are so busy
    finishing the book. Anil is planning to tidy up the toolchain
    and open-source it just as soon as he finds time. All the
    libraries used to build it, such as <a href="http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp">ocaml-cohttp</a> or
    <a href="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github">ocaml-github</a>
    are already all available via <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a>.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about all this, please get in
    touch with <a href="mailto:anil@recoil.org">Anil
    Madhavapeddy</a>.</p>
