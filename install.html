  <p>These instructions are aimed at readers of Real World OCaml,
  though much of what you find here will be useful for anyone who
  wants to get a good working OCaml installation.</p>

  <p>At the highest level, here's what you need to do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#installing-opam">Install opam</a>, OCaml's default
      package manager</li>

    <li><a href="#opam-setup">Set up opam</a>, which means
      initializing opam and then installing the version of OCaml
      you'll need, along with the libraries and tools that will help
      you work through the examples in the book</li>

    <li><a href="#utop-setup">Configure utop</a>, the interactive
      toplevel that will be the primary vehicle we'll use for walking
      through small examples.</li>

    <li><a href="#editor-setup">Set up your editing environment.</a>
    We have pointers for a few editors, including Visual Studio Code,
    Emacs, and Vi</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that Windows is not fully supported by the examples in Real
  World OCaml or by opam, though it's being worked on.  Until that's
  ready, we recommend using a virtual machine running Debian Linux on
  your local machine, or
  <a href="https://docker.com">Docker for Windows</a>.</p>

  <p>Let's get started.</p>

  <h2 id="installing-opam">Installing opam</h2>

  <p>opam is the default package manager for OCaml, and you'll need it
  to get everything else you need installed and set up.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to install opam is through your OS's package
  manager. In most cases, installing opam will also trigger the
  installation of OCaml. The version installed isn't important, since
  we can use opam itself to install other versions of the
  compiler.</p>

  <p>Here
    are <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Using-your-distribution-39-s-package-system">
    platform-specific installation instructions</a> for installing via
    your package manager.  The same page
    has <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Binary-distribution">
    instructions for using a binary installer</a> if you have trouble
    with your package manager.
</p>

  <h2 id="#opam-setup">Setting up opam</h2>

  <h3>Run <code>opam init</code></h3>

  <p>The entire opam package database is held in the
  <code>.opam</code> directory in your home directory, including
  compiler installations. On Linux and macOS, this will be the
  <code>~/.opam</code> directory, which means you don't need
  administrative privileges to configure it. If you run into
  problems configuring opam, just delete the whole
  <code>~/.opam</code> directory and start over.</p>

  <p>Let's begin by initialising the opam package database. We do this
    by running:</p>

  <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
opam init</code></pre>

  <p>Before <code>opam init</code> finishes, it will ask you if you
  want it to adjust some of the config files for your shell.  We
  recommend you say yes here so as to automate adjusting the PATH
  environment variable of your shell and to prepare your environment
  in other ways.</p>

  <p>Note that if for whatever reason your shell is not set up
    properly, you can put it in the right state by running:</p>

    <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
eval $(opam env)</code></pre>

  <p>This evaluates the results of running <code>opam config
  env</code> in your current shell and sets the variables so that
  subsequent commands will use them. This <em>only</em> works with
  your current shell and it can only be automated for future shells by
  adding the line to your login scripts (which is exactly what opam
  offers to do for you in <code>opam init</code>). </p>

  <p>You can check if your environment is set up properly by
  running <code>opam switch</code> with no arguments.  It will emit
  a warning if your shell is not set up correctly, along with
  instructions on how to fix it.</p>
  <pre data-output="2-7" data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
opam switch
#  switch                            compiler                    description
â†’  default                           ocaml-base-compiler.4.09.1  default

[WARNING] The environment is not in sync with the current switch.
          You should run: eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

  <h3>Installing the right compiler</h3>

  <p>Real World OCaml requires OCaml 4.10.0.  You can use <code>opam
      switch</code> to see which version of OCaml you have installed.
      If, as shown in the above invocation of switch, you have an
      older version installed, you can use opam to install a more
      up-to-date version:</p>
  <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
opam switch create 4.10.0
eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

  <p>The <code>opam switch create</code> will take a few minutes on a
  modern machine, and will download and install the new compiler and
  all libraries associated with it in <code>~/.opam/4.10.0</code>.</p>

  <h3>Installing libraries and tools</h3>

  <p>Finally, we're ready to install the libraries and tools we'll
  need for the book. The two important ones are <code>base</code>,
  which provides the standard library that all the examples in the
  book are based on, and <code>utop</code>, which is the
  interactive toplevel that you can use for working through the
  examples.  We can install them as follows. </p>
  <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line">    <code class="language-bash">
opam install base utop
</code></pre>

  <p>But you'll probably want more than this as you work through the
  book.  Here's a more complete list of libraries you should install:</p>
  <pre data-output="2-3" data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line">    <code class="language-bash">
opam install core async yojson core_extended \
     core_bench cohttp-async async_graphics \
     cryptokit menhir
</code></pre>

  <p>If some of the above don't work, don't worry too much. Most of
  them come up in only a few places in the book.</p>

  <h2 id="utop-setup">Setting up and using <code>utop</code></h2>

  <p>When you first run <code>utop</code>, you'll find yourself at an
  interactive prompt with a bar at the bottom of the screen. The
  bottom bar dynamically updates as you write text, and contains the
  possible names of modules or variables that are valid at that point
  in the phrase you are entering. You can press the
  <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key to complete the phrase with the
  first choice.</p>

  <p>The <code>~/.ocamlinit</code> file in your home directory
  initializes <code>utop</code> with common libraries and syntax
  extensions so you don't need to type them in every time. Given
  that you have Core installed, you should update your
  <code>ocamlinit</code> to load Core every time you start
  <code>utop</code>, by adding the following lines.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-ocaml">
#use "topfind";;
#thread;;
#require "core.top";;
</code></pre>

  <p>For <code>utop</code> only you could get away with just the last
  line, but you need the whole thing if you want the
  traditional <code>ocaml</code> toplevel to work too.</p>

  <p>Note that <code>opam</code> will have already added some lines
  to the file. Also, notice that <code>#</code> is used to mark a
  toplevel directive, not a comment.</p>

  <h2 id="editor-setup">Editor set-up</h2>

  In order to have a reasonable editing experience, there are a
  collection of different tools you'll want set up.

  <ul>
    <li> An editor mode that understands the language, and can help
      with the basics of syntax-highlighting and navigation. </li>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">Merlin</a>, which
      provides out of your code, like auto-completion,
      go-to-definition, and type-throwback.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat">ocp-indent</a>,
      which auto-indents your code.
    </li><li> <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat">ocamlformat</a>,
      which provides fully automatic formatting and indentation
      (including line-breaking).
  </li></ul>

  In the following, we'll describe how to set up what you need for
  each of the editors.

  <br><br>
  <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>

  There are several OCaml modes for Visual Studio, but we recommend
  the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform">OCaml Platform plug-in</a>.
  This works alongside a server that supports the Visual
  Studio's <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language
  Server Protocol</a> (LSP).

  Instructions for installing OCaml LSP server can be
  found <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp">here</a>.  These
  instructions show you how to set things up so you can install the
  LSP server via opam.  Eventually the LSP server will be available
  from opam by default.

  <br><br>
  <h3>Emacs</h3>

  opam comes with a <code>user-setup</code> package that can be used
  to install Emacs configs.  You can install it as follows.  Note that
  we first make sure that <code>ocp-indent</code>, an OCaml
  indentation tool, is available, as well as <code>tuareg</code>,
  which is an Emacs mode for OCaml.

  <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
opam install tuareg ocp-indent merlin
opam install user-setup
opam user-setup install</code></pre>

  An alternative to <code>ocp-indent</code>
  is <code>ocamlformat</code>, which is a full-on code formatter, as
  opposed to just an indenter.  <code>user-setup</code> doesn't
  support <code>ocamlformat</code> yet, but you can find
  instructions <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat">here</a>

  If you want fully automatic formatting (as opposed to just
  indentation), you should first install it via opam.

    <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
opam install ocamlformat</code></pre>

    <code>user-setup</code> doesn't support ocamlformat yet, but here
  are <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#emacs-setup">instructions
  for setting up ocamlformat for emacs</a>.

  <br><br>
  <h3>Vim</h3>

  <p>Vim users can use the built-in style for handling OCaml source
  code.  Beyond that, Merlin and other associated tools can be
  installed as follows. </p>

  <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
opam install merlin ocp-indent
opam install user-setup
opam user-setup install</code></pre>

  If you want fully automatic formatting (as opposed to just
  indentation), you should first install it via opam.

    <pre data-host="lama" data-user="rwo" class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">
opam install ocamlformat</code></pre>

    <code>user-setup</code> doesn't support ocamlformat yet, but here
  are <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#vim-setup">instructions
  for setting up ocamlformat for VIM</a>.
